#### Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

## Motivation

Tap Tap Revenge was one of the original hits in music rhythm gaming, the premise of this arcade game was simple. There were orbs that flowed down from the top of the screen to give time for the player to anticipate the beats in the music. When the orbs reach the "line of action", the players were supposed to tap and hold the orb, the goal was to hit the orb **on time** and **hold on** to continue earning points. The "beatmaps" of Tap Tap Revenge were normally manually programmed by a human who would then share their map on the platform for others to play.

Our team has set out to automate this process of beatmap generation using an algorithm that works over MIDI files. We know that the classical music genre is one that is highly structured, which would be ideal for the application of our low-level algorithm. Coincidentally, it is also a highly neglected genre with a wealth of interesting information, we thought we would take this chance to make a classical-music-themed Tap Tap Revenge to fill in this gap.

Between 1 to 6 lanes are allowed and when fewer than 6 lanes are chosen, only the first few key bindings are active. Binding the same key to multiple lanes is allowed (at your own loss of points when playing). | ✅        |

## Game Engine Breakdown

### pretty_midi switch

Before Milestone 3, we had not known about the existence of [pretty_midi](https://craffel.github.io/pretty-midi/). This is a more intuitive library that builds upon [mido](https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We can use it to isolate the note events of any instrument to generate the beatmaps we desire, enabling the player the flexiblity to play the same game with the choice of multiple instruments. We can also use it to get information such as *instruments* and *volume changes*.

```python
from pretty_midi import PrettyMIDI
mid = PrettyMIDI('Fate Symphony.midi')

for instrument in mid.instruments:
  print(f"Instrument: {instrument}")
  volume_changes = [message.value for message in instrument.control_changes if message.number == 7]
  print(f"Volume changes: {volume_changes}")
```

outputs:

```python
Instrument: Instrument(program=73, is_drum=False, name="Flute")
Volume changes: [127]
Instrument: Instrument(program=68, is_drum=False, name="Oboe")
Volume changes: [95]
Instrument: Instrument(program=71, is_drum=False, name="Bb Clarinet")
Volume changes: [95]
Instrument: Instrument(program=70, is_drum=False, name="Bassoon")
Volume changes: [95]
Instrument: Instrument(program=60, is_drum=False, name="Horn in Eb")
Volume changes: [105]
Instrument: Instrument(program=56, is_drum=False, name="C Trumpet")
Volume changes: [105]
Instrument: Instrument(program=47, is_drum=False, name="Timpani")
Volume changes: [100]
Instrument: Instrument(program=48, is_drum=False, name="Violin I")
Volume changes: [100]
Instrument: Instrument(program=48, is_drum=False, name="Violin II")
Volume changes: [100]
Instrument: Instrument(program=48, is_drum=False, name="Violas")
Volume changes: [104]
Instrument: Instrument(program=48, is_drum=False, name="Violoncellos")
Volume changes: [100]
Instrument: Instrument(program=48, is_drum=False, name="Contrabass")
Volume changes: [90]
```

We are also able to manipulate individual note timings, modify volume.

### [midi2audio](https://github.com/bzamecnik/midi2audio) and [Fluidsynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth)

Further library discoveries were made that allowed for the direct output of audio files directly from python. Previously, all the audio files you heard were manually exported from digital audio workstations. This is the last piece of the puzzle that enabled the **Sandbox Mode**. 

## Compatibility Issues

Due to [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) being a less popular open source library than other game engines such as Unity, the library has not been keeping up with Python upgrades and OS upgrades over time. The last stable release was on 25 April 2019 and this version has various compability problems that affects our development.

### Phantom Orbs

For reasons unknown, among songs of longer durations (which would normally imply a greater number of orbs), the visuals of the orbs would break down - orbs that aren't meant to appear would appear on top of other orbs. **Fortunately, this does not happen when pygame 2.0.0.dev10 is being used.** **The stable release is essential when one wishes to deploy the scripts as executables for various OSes. This issue is only pertinent to users who are running the executable version.**

### Audio Issues with certain Windows devices

On Orbitee Mingyi's computer, there were issues using python-vlc to play .wav and .flac files when an active Pygame window is open. Various attempts were made to fix this directly were unsuccessful we had to sidestep it by loading all available game tracks (the background and campaign audio uses mp3 which did not have this issue) before initialising the display. This worked perfectly (at the cost of unneeded RAM usage by preloading unnecessary audio assets) until the implementation of sandbox mode. Because we allow the user to upload his/her own MIDI file to play with, there is now no possible way to preload all possible tracks beforehand. This was solved by performing a re-initialisation of the game before after processing a MIDI file, similar to how the game automatically updates itself after changing an option. However, the audio error reappears in this case and all song tracks are muted, forcing him to manually close and reopen the game to play the newly generated MIDI file.

### Testing

User trials were conducted with our friends on Windows and macOS, alongside later verfications with Parallels VM.
